## fb2k-control
Command-line frontend to the [foo_httpcontrol](https://bitbucket.org/oblikoamorale/foo_httpcontrol) component for [foobar2000](http://foobar2000.org). I wrote this so that, combined with [Slate](https://github.com/jigish/slate) and [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner), I can use my Macbook's media keys to control foobar2000 running via Wine.

## nastify
Unpack an archive and move it somewhere. I wrote this to help get a bunch of free music I'd downloaded from various netlabels onto my NAS, hence the name.
